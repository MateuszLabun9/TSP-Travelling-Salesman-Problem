# TSP-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Project created in C++, implementation of Genetic Algorithm in Traveling Slesman problem. 
Program reads from text file graph vertices and using genetic algorithm  designates the shortest path along all vertices.
There are three assumptions:
 - The traveling salesman passes through each vertex only once.
 - Each vertex in the graph is connected to all other vertices.
 - The path determined by the program begins at the selected point, eg "A" and ends there as well.
